        <h4>
            <h2>1. Why should I take your course?</h2>
10/40 takes firsthand business experience in the lectures and combines it with the business knowledge of a Harvard MBA graduate who’s been involved in over twenty-five startups; a retired Air Force colonel and four-time war veteran who built a very successful company with no previous business experience; a business professor who spent several years doing business as mission in Iraq; and a serial entrepreneur who started his first company at eighteen and is currently the CEO of several others. Additionally, the course is tailored to fit either into your homeschool curriculum or be taken at a more leisurely pace. 10/40 also aims to equip you with the tools you need to start your own business and succeed. Finally, 10/40 is priced affordably.
<br><br>
<h2>2. How much does it cost?</h2>
The course costs $55/month per user for six months. After the six months, if you desire continued access, you will receive 20% off of the monthly price.
<br><br>
<h2>3. Are group discounts available?</h2>
Yes! 10/40 works well for co-ops and other large groups seeking to learn more about small business. If you have a group of 8 or more, email info@my1040academy.com to inquire about group pricing. Please keep in mind that if you receive a group discount, your post 6-month subscription will be $30/month. Email to inquire.
<br><br>
<h2>4. What is the recommended age range?</h2>
The recommended age range is eighth grade and higher.
<br><br>
<h2>5. How long does the course last?</h2>
The course is designed to last ten weeks, but it is as flexible as you are. There are eight lectures, quizzes, and corresponding action steps for business planning and startup, in addition to recommended reading. 
<br><br>
<h2>6. Can I have multiple users on one account?</h2>
Unless you received expressed written consent, the material in this course is intended to only be viewed and used by the single person enrolled on your account. Having multiple users on one account is stealing, and we ask that you respect the effort, time, intellectual property, and finances invested in developing this course.
<br><br>
<h2>7. Can I stack promo codes?</h2>
We do not allow multiple promo codes to be used in order to secure a double discount. Only one promo code can be used per account.
<br><br>
<h2>8. Who created the course?</h2>
Christopher O’Rear, a homeschool graduate, designed the content for 10/40. He has years of business experience, having most recently founded a social media marketing company. Christopher is currently a college sophomore studying business. In addition to entrepreneurship, his passions include soccer (currently playing on his college’s varsity team), piano, falconry, and writing.

<br><br>
<h2>9. What does 10/40 stand for?</h2>
This program is named after the 10/40 Window. According to research compiled by the Joshua Project, the majority of the world’s un-evangelized countries are found in the 10/40 window. “Un-evangelized people” are defined as those “who have a minimal knowledge of the gospel but have no valid opportunity to respond to it.” In addition, this section of the globe includes the majority of the world’s Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. Out of the 4.89 billion people living in this section, 3.02 billion are considered “unreached,” leaving only 38% of the population as reached for the gospel. 
<br><br>
According to the Joshua Project, “Of the poorest of the poor, more than eight out of ten live in the 10/40 window. On average they exist on less than a few hundred dollars per person per year.” The world’s poorest live in this region.
<br><br>
Christopher, the founder of 10/40, is passionate about Business As Mission (BAM), a model of missions that uses small business as a means to introduce people to Jesus Christ. Following Jesus’ example of meeting people’s spiritual and physical needs, BAM is especially relevant in the 10/40 window, where the majority of the world’s poorest and un-evangelized people groups are. His goal is to equip the church to use business as a means of glorifying God and expanding His kingdom.
